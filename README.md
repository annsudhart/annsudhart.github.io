# Andrea Sudharta's Website

Welcome to the GiHub repo for my website
[annsudhart.github.io](https://annsudhart.github.io)! 

### How this was built
I used the following to build the website:  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery
- npm
- ReactJS
- create-react-app
- react-twitter-embed
- Google Fonts  

Planning on adding Less CSS preprocessor and cleaning up the design of the website overall.

### Repository structure

The actual code used to make the website is on branch `source`.

`public`, `src`, are folders containing the public assets and the ReactJS source code used to build the website. `.babelrc`, `.gitignore`, `manifest.json`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `yarn.lock` are also configuration files used when building this website. 

Any other files are dumps from `public` to the home directory of this repo so that GitHub Pages can use the repo to generate the actual website.
