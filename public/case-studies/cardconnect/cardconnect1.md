# CardConnect

*In today's digital world, employers and job seekers need to make sharing contact information easier...*

## Overview/Background
Every year, 27 million business cards are printed, ready to be exchanged and end up on someone’s pile of cards. With so many cards, recruiters and businesspeople have to deal with a clutter of information, eventually to be transferred manually from card to computer. Seeing this, a group of two people and I came to the conclusion that perhaps physical business cards don’t belong in the digital world. Through storyboarding, we identified personas that helped us narrow down our audience to employers and job-seekers, which led to a final product.

This final product is CardConnect, an app that addresses the heaps of contact information that people process to get in touch with one another. With a digital business card-reading app, business card holders can more efficiently share and use the information within business cards. Not only did I help with the CSS of the actual product and the overall functionality of the contacts list with JavaScript, I also conducted A/B testing on both the original plan for the contacts app and an alternative design that we eventually adopted.

## Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, employers and job seekers need to make sharing contact information simpler and easier than inconvenient processes such as manually transferring information from card to computer. We can solve this by storing and retrieving business cards from digital databases on a mobile app.

These numbers tell us how ubiquitous and important business cards are for businesses. Indeed, business cards provide a great way to advertise your brand in a quick manner. Yet, only a few people put their business card info into a digital list or into their phone.

This isn’t to say that digitizing business cards isn’t a good idea. According to members of the Forbes Agency Council, digitizing business cards, taking notes on them, and especially following up online afterwards can be a great way to utilize them. But because most methods of digitally sharing and synthesizing business card information are time consuming, we see a “friction” in the flow of information. This creates an opportunity to create something that provides a quick, seamless way to transfer information in a way that keeps value brand information and advertisement.
