# CardConnect

## Overview/Background
Every year, 27 million business cards are printed, ready to be exchanged and end up on someone’s pile of cards. With so many cards, recruiters and businesspeople have to deal with a clutter of information, eventually to be transferred manually from card to computer. Seeing this, a group of two people and I came to the conclusion that perhaps physical business cards don’t belong in the digital world. Through storyboarding, we identified personas that helped us narrow down our audience to employers and job-seekers, which led to a final product.

This final product is CardConnect, an app that addresses the heaps of contact information that people process to get in touch with one another. With a digital business card-reading app, business card holders can more efficiently share and use the information within business cards. Not only did I help with the CSS of the actual product and the overall functionality of the contacts list with JavaScript, I also conducted A/B testing on both the original plan for the contacts app and an alternative design that we eventually adopted.

## Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, employers and job seekers need to make sharing contact information simpler and easier than inconvenient and tedious processes such as manually transferring information from card to computer. This can be solved by storing and retrieving business cards from digital databases on a mobile app.
