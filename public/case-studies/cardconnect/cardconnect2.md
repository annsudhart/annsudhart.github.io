These numbers tell us how ubiquitous and important business cards are for businesses. Indeed, business cards provide a great way to advertise your brand in a quick manner. Yet, only a few people put their business card info into a digital list or into their phone.

This isn’t to say that digitizing business cards isn’t a good idea. According to members of the Forbes Agency Council, digitizing business cards, taking notes on them, and especially following up online afterwards can be a great way to utilize them. But because most methods of digitally sharing and synthesizing business card information are time consuming, we see a “friction” in the flow of information. This creates an opportunity to create something that provides a quick, seamless way to transfer information in a way that keeps value brand information and advertisement.
## Prototypes

### Storyboards

By storyboarding, we have come up with two different scenarios for using our CardConnect app. In the first scenario, we thought of a person who would use CardConnect to synthesize information quickly and save someone’s contact information from a business card for later use, rather than fumbling through a mess and scrambling to follow up. Then, we thought of CardConnect from the perspective of someone who would go digital to keep all of their information in one place, showing the need for a reliable storage space for information that can be used to follow up with someone quickly.. Important ways in which these two depend on the app is for saving information when networking and taking action after obtaining the information.

### Competitive Audit
There are many business card reading apps of various qualities. So, we took a look at different
apps that were on the App store and conducted a competitive audit. Through this, we were inspired to not only provide a scanning service for the business cards, but to also provide key features, such as searchable contacts, and introduce a way to create your own business card online and edit it.
