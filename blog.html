	<p>I would like to announce that I have won my first hackathon!
	   The hackathon was called HackXX, run by SDHacks, and it happened
	   from 4/7-4/8. For my project,
	   I worked with two other people to create an app that encouraged
	   girls to immerse themselves more in math!
	</p>
	<p>
	   It was a great experience because I got to learn how to collaborate
	   with other people on a greater scale than usual. Especially since
	   I only had experience using Git on solo projects, using Git to work
	   with many different people allowed me to learn how to use Git
	   in a real-world fashion. That was one of the hugest problems I had
	   in working in the hackathon: learning to do <em>git pull</em>
	   , then <em>git add</em>, then <em>git commit</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
	   I feel great after winning first place out of all of the other
	   great projects developed! This really encourages me to do some
	   more creating and go to more hackathons!
