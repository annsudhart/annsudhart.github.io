By storyboarding, we have come up with two different scenarios for using our CardConnect app. In the first scenario, we thought of a person who would use CardConnect to synthesize information quickly and save someoneâ€™s contact information from a business card for later use, rather than fumbling through a mess and scrambling to follow up. Then, we thought of CardConnect from the perspective of someone who would go digital to keep all of their information in one place, showing the need for a reliable storage space for information that can be used to follow up with someone quickly.. Important ways in which these two depend on the app is for saving information when networking and taking action after obtaining the information.

There are many business card reading apps of various qualities. So, we took a look at different
apps that were on the App store and conducted a competitive audit. Through this, we were inspired to not only provide a scanning service for the business cards, but to also provide key features, such as searchable contacts, and introduce a way to create your own business card online and edit it.
